# process-network

# What is this

College project from course of operating systems.
It was a project made to practice inter-process communication and system call usage. Most of the default system calls were used, such as forking, reading, writing, executing and piping (both unnamed and named pipes).

# What does it do

The project allows the user to create a network of processes in such a way as to process data in a continuous fashion (Apache Storm does this same thing).
Having an interface that allows for mapping of processes that work in relation to each other allows for a more readable and scalable manipulation of data.
Below are listed 3 pratical examples in which the network is used. Note that everything listed is included in the repository
