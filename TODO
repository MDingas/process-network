Regarding forked graphs, It uses a sleep() whose value is an estimate of how long the cat will take.
This is not ideal, because currently it only takes into acount the number of nodes and not the size of input.
Possible simple fix: before doing the cat command, check the number of bytes on the file and use that value to help on the sleep() estimate.
